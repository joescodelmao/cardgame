# cardgame
card game project that I designed
based of the popular card game "War"

SIMPLE GUIDELINES:
1. Players: The game is played between two players.

2. Objective: The goal of the game is to win all the cards or to have the most cards at the end when one player reaches a specified score (in this case, 10 points).

3. Deck: The deck consists of 52 cards, split into 4 suits: Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades. Each suit contains 13 cards, ranked from 2 to Ace. The value of the cards follows the ranking: 2 is the lowest, and Ace is the highest.

4. Card Distribution: The deck is shuffled, and cards are evenly distributed between the two players.

Gameplay:
1. Draw Cards: On each turn, both players draw a card from their deck. The players' cards are compared based on value.
2. Winning a Round: The player with the higher card value wins the round and takes both cards. If both cards have the same value, the cards are discarded.
3. Points: The winner of each round receives 1 point, and the round is repeated until one player reaches a score of 10 points.
4. Game End: The game ends when a player reaches a score of 10. A message is displayed declaring the winner.
5. Tie: In case of a tie (same card values), the cards are discarded and no points are awarded.
